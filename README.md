# Portfolio - devChallenges

This is a simple <a target="_blank" href="https://devchallenges.io/challenges/5ZnOYsSXM24JWnCsNFlt">devChallenges</a> project. In it I used HTML5, Sass and JavaScript, basically.

- I used both Grid and FlexBox to organize the content and make the page responsive.
- I used JavaScript to build the project filter.
- In this project I also used Gulp to compile .scss to .css and to make JavaScript work in older browsers with Babel. With Gulp I also minified both CSS and JavaScript.
